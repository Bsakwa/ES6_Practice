// We will do a demonstration of string interpolation in JS


// String Interpolation
let name = 'Sakwa';
let age = 25;

console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
// Output: My name is John and I am 25 years old.

// We can also use template literals for string interpolation
console.log(`The sum of 5 and 10 is ${5 + 10}`);
// Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
